This site has some lists of the most difficult sport climbing achievements in the world and in the UK. The idea is to hopefully give some perspective on the current state of sport climbing.

Here's synopsis of the hardest redpoints of last year.


## Hardest Ascents of 2020

Despite the pandemic and the fact that many top climbers focused on Olympic training this was the third highest year for 9b and harder ascents with a total of 11. 2019 was the highest year with 14 ascents followed by 2018 with 13.

Seven of these ascents were made by climbers who had not climbed 9b before.

2020 was also the first year Adam Ondra didn't climb a 9b since he climbed his first, *Golpe De Estado* in Siurana, in 2010. He came close to a redpoint of *Perfecto Mundo* though.

Also notable was Julia Chanoudie's ascent of *Eagle-4*, the second female to climb 9b. And Angy Eiter, who was the first woman to climb 9b in 2017, became the first woman to make the F.A of a 9b with *Madame Ching*.

Stefano Ghisolfi's second ascent of *Change* means he is the second person to climb more than 1 9b+. This was his 8th route of 9b or above making him second only to Adam Ondra who has climbed 23.

Last and definitely not least was Alex Megos's ascent of *Bibliography*. This is only the second route in the world to get the 9c grade after Ondra's *Silence* in 2017 and so it could be the world's hardest route at the moment.
