US climber Matty Hong made the second ascent of Tommy Caldwell's route *Flex Luthor* at the Fortress of Solitude, a huge cave near Rifle in Colorado.

The 2003 route was the first 9a+ or 5.15a route in America. But after 3 seasons of attempts Matty Hong suggests an upgrade to 9b or 5.15b. It's worth noting that Hong has climbed multiple 9a+'s in Europe as well as *Fight or Flight* an established Sharma 9b at Oliana. If the grade sticks it could make it the first 9b in the world, beating Chris Sharma's 2008 route, *Jumbo Love* by 5 years. The only question is how much the route has changed in the 18 years between.

Hong says: 

> It’s undeniable some aspects of the route have changed over the years, however I believe the majority of the climb has stayed intact.

Holds have been pulled off during previous failed attempts by other climbers. Hong himself says he broke around half a dozen handholds and 20 footholds.

But Hong says:

> There are a couple sections of choss, but that’s just how climbing in Colorado is. The majority of the route is on quite good rock. The crux especially.

Hong reckons that crux is V12 (font 8A+) and comes after a pumpy intro section. He thinks to get through that crux from the ground would be 9a+ and the rest of the route would be 8c with a V7 or V8 (font 7B) boulder problem to finish.

## The first 9b ?

Was this the first 9b in the world? Hong is uncertain, not least because he does not know which holds broke off before his attempts. Tommy Caldwell feels that he was well behind Sharma at the time but concedes that the climbing on *Flex Luthor* is a 'weird style' with kneebars, handjams and 'crazy stuff'.

So for now no one knows and we may never know. Caldwell has said he intends to go back on the route himself as he can still remember the moves from his first ascent. Will he be able to tell if the missing holds were important holds after all this time? Who knows? But that will probably be the only chance to get something approaching a definitive answer. 

## US 9b list

*Flex Luthor* is one of 3 9b routes in the US now.
