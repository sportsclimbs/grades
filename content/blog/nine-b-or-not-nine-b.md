summary: Alex Megos's repeat of Mejorando Imagen
---

...that is the question.

With the site up for barely a day an ascent by Alex Megos has already caused difficulties for the list of 9b's.

The ascent in question is the second ascent of a Margalef '9a' put up in 2013 by Ramon Julian Puigblanque. After taking over a week to complete the ascent Alex has suggested upgrading the route to 9b. This seems reasonable enough. Alex is not exactly shit at Marglef. Aside from making the first ascent of the hardest route there, Perfecto Mundo (9b+), he also made quick work of Sharma's First Round First Minute taking only 5 days as well making a one day ascent of Sharma's brutal roof route Dementia Senile (9a+). So the upgrade seems fair and logical enough.

However things get trickier when viewed from Ramon's side. The small but powerful Spanish climber made the first ascent in just 7 tries spread over 3 days way back when 9b+ had barely been establshed. If it is 9b that would make it one of, if not the, fastest ascents of a 9b ever (other contenders being Will Bosi's ascent of La Capella and Adam Ondra's ascent of C.R.S). Now Ramon is no stranger to hard routes having completed 68 routes of 8c+/9a or harder, including 13 9a+'s. But interestingly he has never climbed a 9b. His hardest route on paper is his own, unrepeated, extention to Cataxa at Santa Linya, rated 9a+/b.

Things get even less certain when we look at the details of Megos's ascent. According to him he very nearly completed the route on his 3rd day. Had he done so would he have still suggested the 9b grade? Unfortunately for Alex things then took a turn for the worse and he spent the next week unable to get past the crux again. He finally completed the route when he had pretty much given up and had to go up to get his draws out. According to him he was tired, had sore skin and climbed badly. 

Adam Ondra might have suggested the same of another Ramon 9a  at Margalef, Victimas Perez. He had a lot more difficulty with this that one would expect for a man who has onsighted 9a and typically climbs that grade in one day. However the difference is that this route had already had 8 repeats confirming Ramon's grade of 9a.

So for now the now the difficulty of *Mejorando Imagen* is uncertain. Should this be in the list of 9b's? I'm not sure. I'll defer to Escalade 9 who gave it 9a/b, a split of the grade from the two people who have climbed the route.
