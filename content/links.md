1. [Escalade 9](http://escalade9.wifeo.com/) - fantastic database of every grade 9 ascent.
2. [8a.nu](https://8a.nu) - up to date news and logbooks of top climbers.
3. [Planet Mountain](https://www.planetmountain.com/)
4. [Climbing History](https://climbing-history.org/) - a good resource but rather messy and randomly updated.
5. [Climber](https://www.climber.co.uk/news/) probably the best source for UK based news.
6. [UK Climbing](https://www.ukclimbing.com/) has a weekly digest of news but sometimes misses significant ascents.
7. La Crux
