This is a short story about the world’s 9b+ sport routes and the climbers who have climbed them. First, a few facts for some context. 9b+, or 5.15c, is currently the second hardest sport climbing grade. There are nine recognized 9b+ routes in the world. Four of these have been repeated and have had their grades confirmed (for the most part—more on this later). Five have yet to see a repeat.

Six routes around the world fall somewhere between 9b and 9b+ and are often referred to as 9b/+. They’ve been granted this slash grade directly from their first ascensionist or indirectly through grade debate from different ascensionists.

The world’s hardest sport grade is 9c (9c). There are only two 9c routes currently in existence—Adam Ondra’s *Silence* and Seb Bouin’s *DNA*—neither of which has seen a repeat.

Let’s run through the history of the 9b+ grade in sport climbing&mdash;the routes, the first ascensionists, the repeats&mdash;touching on important 9b/+ and 9c routes along the way.

## The Ondra Era (2012–2017)

The world’s first consensus 9b+ was *Change*, first sent by Adam Ondra in October 2012 in the famous Flatanger cave in Norway. A little over four months later, Ondra would go on to make the FA of the world’s second 9b+, *La Dura Dura* in Oliana, Spain in February 2013. Chris Sharma repeated the route the following month.

Ondra made the FA of the world’s third 9b+, *Vasil Vasil* in the Czech Republic, nearly a year later, in December 2013. The route has never been repeated. It’s important to note here that Ondra made the FA of *Move* in Flatanger, Norway a few months prior, grading the route 9b/+. Seb Bouin would go on to repeat the route in 2019 and suggest an upgrade to 9b+.

After Ondra’s send of *Vasil Vasil* in December 2023, nearly four years elapsed before another route harder than 9b was sent—and again it was put up by Ondra. On September 3, 2017 he sent the world’s first 9c, *Silence* in Flatanger.

By early May 2018, the 9b+ club remained at a membership of two—Ondra and Sharma.

## The Megos Years (2018–2020)

In early May 2018, German climber Alex Megos made the first ascent of *Perfecto Mundo*, 9b+, in Margalef. He was the first climber not named Adam Ondra to make a 9b+ first ascent. Italian climber Stefano Ghisolfi repeated the line in December that year, and Austrian climber Jakob Schubert made the third ascent in 2019.

In Summer 2020, Megos made the first ascent of *Bibliographie* in Céüse, proposing a grade of 9c. The world now had two 9c’s: Ondra’s *Silence* and Megos’ *Bibliographie*.

A few other repeats and first ascents mark this era. In 2019, Bouin put up *La Rage d’Adam* and in 2020 he made the FA of *Beyond Integral*, grading both routes the slash grade of 9b/+. As mentioned above, in 2019 he also repeated Ondra’s *Move*, suggesting an upgrade to 9b+. With this repeat of *Move* and FAs of *La Rage d’Adam* and *Beyond Integral*, Bouin had three 9b/+’s to his name, but no confirmed 9b+.

Ghisolfi made big news in Fall 2020, repeating Ondra’s *Change* 9b+ and confirming the grade.

By the end of 2020, the 9b+ club included Ondra, Sharma, Megos, Ghisolfi, Schubert, and likely Bouin, depending on how the grades of *Move*, *La Rage d’Adam*, and *Beyond Integral* will settle over time.


## The Year of the Downgrades (2021)

In August 2021, Ghisolfi made the second ascent of Megos’ *Bibliographie* 9c and suggested a downgrade to 9b+—huge news in the climbing world. At the time (and still true today) Ghisolfi had repeated more 9b+ routes than any other climber—*Perfecto Mundo*, *Change*, and *Bibliographie*—and thus had a solid understanding of the grade. Megos agreed with the downgrade suggestion, cementing *Bibliographie* as 9b+ and leaving Silence as the world’s only 9c. American climber Sean Bailey would go on to make the third ascent of *Bibliographie* a month later.

In March 2021, British climber Will Bosi made the first ascent of *King Capella* in Siurana, proposing a grade of 9b+. In Novemeber that year, Megos went on to repeat the route but did not comment on the grade, although he did say he found a different sequence. Schubert made the third ascent the following month an suggested a grade of 9b. In a single day he sent both *King Capella* and Ondra’s and *La Capella*, downgrading that route too—from 9b to 9a+.

## The Year of Bouin (2022)

In Spring 2022, Bouin made the first ascent of *DNA* in Verdon Gorge proposing a grade of 9c. With *Bibliographie* downgraded to 9b+, *DNA* would join *Silence* as the only other 9c route in the world. The line has yet to see a repeat.

On a trip to Norway in Summer 2022, Bouin repeated the world’s original 9b+, *Change*. He said the route was less difficult than Move and suggested a grade of 9b/+. Unlike Ondra during the FA, Bouin used kneepads for his repeat (as did Ghisolfi). As more sends rack up in the future, will ascensionists agree with Bouin? Will *Change* remain the world’s first 9b+?

On the same trip, Bouin also made the first ascent of *Nordic Marathon*, a 130-metre mega line through the entire cave. A lover of slash grades, he again graded this route 9b/+. In Fall 2022, he went on to make FA of *Suprême Jumbo Love* in California, grading it 9b+—the first of the grade in the Americas.

In March, Ondra made the FA of *Wonderland* in Arco, Italy, grading the route 9b/+. In November, he sent a 9b+ for the first time since late 2013. He made the first ascent of *Zvěřinec* in his home country, grading the line 9b+ and proving the Ondra era of sport climbing is not over.

By the end of 2022, the 9b+ club included seven climbers: Ondra, Sharma, Megos, Ghisolfi, Schubert, Bailey, and Bouin. Of these seven, only four had put up 9b+ or 9c first ascents: Ondra, Megos, and Bouin.

## New 9b+ FAs (2023)

We’re only two months in to 2023, there have already been two new 9b+ routes. The first was *Excalibur* in Arco by Ghisolfi. Although he had several 9b+ repeats to his name this was his first 9b+ FA.

Earlier this month, Spanish climber Jorge Díaz-Rullo made the first ascent of his Margalef project, *Mejorando la Samfaina*, grading it 9b+. Both *Excalibur* and *Mejorando la Samfaina* have yet to see a repeat.

To date, the 9b+ club includes eight climbers: Ondra, Sharma, Megos, Ghisolfi, Schubert, Bailey, Bouin, and Díaz-Rullo. Five of these climbers have put up 9b+ first ascents: Ondra, Megos, Bouin, Ghisolfi, and Díaz-Rullo.

Another 9b+ or harder may be coming soon in 2023. Ondra and Schubert, for example, have been working hard on “*Project Big*” in the Flatanger Cave. You can learn more about the route here.
