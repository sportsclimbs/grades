It's almost a decade since Adam Ondra climbed the world's first 9b+, *Change* in Flatanger, Norway. This year, 2021, has been a big year for the 9b+ grade with two new climbers added to this very elite list. Early in the year Scottish climber Will Bosi made the first ascent of an existing project in the La Capella sector at Siurana in Spain. Named  *King Capella* he gave it the 9b+ grade because it was significantly harder than the nearby Ondra 9b *La Capella*. Later in the year American Sean Bailey made a relatively quick third ascent of Alex Megos's *Bibliography* at Ceuse in France.

The Italian climber Laura Rogora made the second ascent of Stefano Ghisolfi's *Erebor* a route that had been given a slash grade by Ghisolfi, 9b/+. Slash grades usually suggest uncertainty about the difficulty of a route so future consensus could end up being 9b or 9b+. If the latter it will probably be the first female to climb this grade. 

With all this action it seems like a good time to take stock of who's who in the 9b+ world.

## Most 9b's

Of the 7 9b+ climbers above who has climbed the most routes of 9b or above? No prizes for guessing who's on top. But it's interesting to note that Chris Sharma, who hasn't climbed a route at this level since his 2015 first ascent of *El Bonne Combat* was only knocked out of his no. 2 spot this year by Stefano Ghisolfi. It's also interesting that the only other American listed is the complete opposite. After climbing only a few 9a+'s Sean Bailey skipped the 9b grade altogether to make the third and fastest ascent of *Bibliography*.
