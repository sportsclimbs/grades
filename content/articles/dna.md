On the 5th May 2022 Seb Bouin completed his long term project DNA at Ramirole cliff in the Verdon Gorge. Graded 9c this could make it the hardest route in the world. 

After Alex Megos's *Bibliography* was repeated and downgraded to 9b+ only other 9c candidate is Adam Ondra's 2017 route *Silence* in the Flatanger cave in Norway.

But is DNA really 9c? Seb has never climbed an established 9b+ route so far. But he does has a lot of experience with hard routes having climbed 72 routes from 8c+/9a and up[^1]. In the 9b range the established routes he has climbed are *Chilam Balam* (9a+/b), *Mamichula* (9b) and *Move* (9b/+). Other routes he's climbed at this level are all new routes that are unrepeated: *The Dream* in 2019 (9b), *La Rage d'Adam* also in 2019 (9b/+) and *Beyond Intégrale* in 2020 (9b/+).

Here are Seb's thoughts[^2] on DNA and how he arrived at the 9c grade:

> There would be two possible scenarios, 9b+ or 9c. I have added up the arguments for both. I considered the feeling, the comparison with other routes (Bibliography, Move, Beyond,...) at the level of time and feeling, the climbing style. I questioned myself on my experience and my legitimacy. I also considered the fact that it is a FA. Choosing 9b+ would be playing it safe. Choosing 9c would be taking a risk.
> 
> I have been playing it safe since 2014 on this cliff by proposing very tight grades. And in the end, nobody has repeated one of these routes. Comparing this route to Bibliographie, Move, Beyond, it seems a step ahead (considering time invesment, feeling, and climbing style. Ramirole is 100% my climbing style).
> 
> To choose 9c is to take a risk. A risk of seeing your route downgraded. As there is only one 9c proposed in the world, it's quite hard to be sure and confident. I have never tried a route of such a difficulty. Would this route be in the same league as Silence? Have I not spent all this time partly because of the process of first ascension?
> 
> Despite these doubts, I take the risk of proposing the highest of the grades. The 9c should be taken as a "proposal", which now needs other climbers to give their opinions - to confirm or to adjust. This is how gradings are built: The sum of opinions makes the grading less and less subjective. Our sport is beautiful, we don't need judges, we are the judges. Being an athlete and judging your own performance is beautiful, but at the same time difficult.
> 
> That's why I would like to invite other climbers to come and try DNA. It's a beautiful route, in an incredible location, not too far from the rest of the world. I think DNA has everything to interest and please.
> 
> Thank you to all the people who have been involved in this process, it's an unforgettable slice of life.
