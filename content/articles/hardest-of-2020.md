Despite the pandemic and the fact that many top climbers focused on Olympic training this was the third highest year for ascents of 9b or harder with a total of 11. 2019 was the highest year with 14 ascents followed by 2018 with 13.

Seven of these ascents were made by climbers who had not climbed 9b before.

2020 was also the first year Adam Ondra didn't climb a 9b since he climbed his first, *Golpe De Estado* in Siurana, in 2010. He came close to a redpoint of *Perfecto Mundo* though.

The high point of the year was undoubtedly Alex Megos's ascent of *Bibliography* in Ceuse. This is the second route in the world to get the 9c grade after Ondra's *Silence* in 2017 and so it could be the world's hardest route at the moment.

Stefano Ghisolfi's second ascent of *Change* means he is the third person to climb multiple routes of 9b+ or harder. This was his 8th route of 9b or above making him second only to Adam Ondra who has climbed 23!!

Julia Chanoudie became the second female to climb 9b with her ascent of *Eagle-4*. And Angy Eiter, who was the first woman to climb 9b in 2017, became the first woman to make the F.A of a 9b with *Madame Ching*.
