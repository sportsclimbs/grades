So I decided to remove *La Capella* from the list of routes of 9b and above after Jakob Schubert's fast repeat and subsequent suggestion that the route was 9a+ rather than 9b.

This was a really tough and difficult decision and it's far from clear to me that it's the correct one. But whether in or out a decision had to be made. Below is my thought process on the matter.



Jakob Schubert made the third ascent of Will Bosi's *King Capella* and the fifth ascent Adam Ondra's *La Capella* at the end of 2021 redpointing both routes on the same day. He has suggested downgrading both routes by one grade: *King Capella* from 9b+ to 9b and *La Capella* from 9b to 9a+.

From an Instagram post he says:

> Talking about the grades is difficult as always especially on these bouldery routes but I could see them both being one grade easier than previously suggested.. King Capella probably felt like a hard 9b to me and La Capella definitely didnâ€™t feel harder than 9a+ but those are just my thoughts.

### 9b+ climbers up to 2021

As of 2021 only 6 people have climbed 9b+.

1. Adam Ondra (2012)
2. Chris Sharma (2013)
3. Alex Megos (2018)
4. Stefano Ghisolfi (2018)
5. Jakob Schubert (2019)
6. Sean Bailey (2021)

The grade of *La Capella* is significant not only for *La Capella* itself but because it's the basis of the grade of the nearby route *King Capella* which at the original grade of 9b+ would make it one of top 7 routes in the world.

Adam Ondra made the first ascent of *La Capella* way back in 2011. At that time it was only his second 9b after his second ascent of Chris Sharma's *Golpe de Estado* almost a year earlier. At the time Adam was unsure about the grade and said that *La Capella* might be only 9a+. understandable with so little experience of the 9b grade at that time. 

*La Capella* had to wait another 7 years before Stefano Ghisolfi made the second ascent the route in 2018. He broke a hold on crux of the route making it harder and it took him 10 days to complete the route. This was Stefano's fourth route of the grade.

### Jakob Schubert's 9b's

1. Fight or Flight (2014)
2. La Planta de Shiva (2016)
3. Stoking the Fire (2018)
4. El Bonne Combat (2018)
5. Neanderthal (2018)
6. Perfecto Mundo (2019)
7. King Capella (2021)

The third ascent came from Daniel Woods a month later and the fourth by Will Bosi came in 2020. Neither of these climbers had climbed 9b before and both accepted the grade the route was given.

Bosi climbed the route in only 3 days which was not only phenomenal for 


Bosi used the grade of *La Capella* as the basis for his grade for *King Capella* the following year because it "felt a full grade harder".

In contrast to these climbers when Schubert had climbed the route he had 5 9b's and one 9b+, *Perfecto Mundo*. So he had more experience on which to base his opinion. 

But more significantly is the speed at which he climbed these routes. He climbed *La Capella* on the first go of his second day AND after having redpointed *King Capella* first. If the route is 9b that would be the fastest ascent of a route of that grade by far. The same goes for *King Capella* which he completed in just 4 days. The fastest 9b+ ascents so far have all taken more than ten days. 



This means the number of climbers to have climbed 9b+ has dropped from 7 to 6 and the number of climbers to have climbed has 9b dropped by 1 down to 29. Will Bosi is dropped from the very elite group of 9b+ climbers and Daniel Woods drops out of the 9b group as *La Capella* was his only 9b ascent.

So why trust Schubert's estimation of the grades of these two routes over that of the previous ascensionists? To answer that we need to look at the history of these routes.
Is it possible that Jakob has made a leap in his climbing perhaps combined with the fact that these routes suit him really well? Absolutely. Jakob won the lead event in the Olympics in impressive style. He has a string of impressive hard and fast ascents in both bouldering and lead and is undoubtedly one of the very top climbers in the world. But with Adam Ondra's initial statement that *La Capella* might only be 9a+ along with Will Bosi's relatively speedy ascents of both of these routes it seems more likely that Jakob's suggestion for the grades is correct. 

But only time will tell.
