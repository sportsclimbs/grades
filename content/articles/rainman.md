On 13th May 2022 Spanish climber, Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña, made the second ascent of Steve McClure's 2017 route *Rainman*, believed to be the UK's hardest route and the only UK route to be graded 9b.

The route links *Rainman* (9a) into *Batman* (9a/+) taking in the cruxes of both routes. In the past two years *Rainman* has seen concerted attempts by Josh Ibbetson and Toby Roberts and all 3 climbers have climbed these two routes.

Eder found several kneebar rests not used by Steve McClure so whether the 9b grade stays remains to be seen. However it should be noted that Eder is something of a kneebar master, able to get kneebars where no one else can and trained specifically for this one.

>  When I first tried the kneebar I couldn’t get no hands, took me 3-4 sessions to get 5 seconds no hands, and months training my legs so I could stay longer, last November managed for the first time 1 min on the kneebar and after a winter of training I got 3 min for the first time last month. The kneebar is hard very painful and super intense, what you see on the video is the outcome of loads of really hard work, loads of pain and loads off pinning off the kneebar buttering your knees… My mate Josh Ibertson is also trying the route with the same knee pads and he struggles to get 30 seconds no hands… he is been trying the route for as long as I have.
> 
> So the training, I did loads of strength training like weighted squad deadlifting. Also some pain tolerance training for my right toes, because the kneebar is so intense that my right toe will really hurt due to the pressure you inevitably apply on the heel. All that pressure transfers through the shoe getting really tight on the toes.
> 
> I also did loads of explosive jumping. Calf raises… but the specific for the route where kneebar behind de campus and body crunches every other day, and the pain tolerance by adding weight to my calf raises on really painful footholds. The toes were really painful due to the particularity of the foothold.
> 
> On this particular kneebar, (see the picture), I use my left leg to still push my right foot into place to keep a more stable pose. I found that the more comfortable way to stay on the kneebar.
 
 Eder climbed his first 9a's *Rainshadow* and *Batman* in 2021 and came close to repeating the 9a *Northern Lights* at Kilnsey too.
