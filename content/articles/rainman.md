On 13th May 2022 Spanish climber, Eder Lomba Lopez de IpinÌƒa, made the second ascent of Steve McClure's 2017 route *Rainman*, believed to be the UK's hardest route and the only UK route to be graded 9b.

The route links *Rainman* (9a) into *Batman* (9a/+) taking in the cruxes of both routes. In the past two years *Rainman* has seen concerted attempts by Josh Ibbetson and Toby Roberts and all 3 climbers have climbed these two routes.

Eder found several kneebar rests not used by Steve McClure so whether the 9b grade stays remains to be seen. However it should be noted that Eder is something of a kneebar master, able to get kneebars where no one else can.

Eder climbed his first 9a's *Rainshadow* and *Batman* in 2021 and came close to repeating the 9a *Northern Lights* at Kilnsey too.

Here is the uncut footage of the ascent by [Monoculture films](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqUDPYnSsSE0kV1OOz4c2_Q):
