 Northern Lights is not only hard but has an interesting history.

 It was first bolted by Mark Leach after his successful ascent of Malham's *Cry Freedom* (8b+). He gave up on the project and it was taken over by Ben Moon. He felt it could be the next level, a grade up from *Hubble*, at the time graded 8c+. But after considerable effort Moon too gave up on the route. Steve McClure then stepped in and, again after considerable effort, better beta and a slightly different line completed the project in July 2000. It was Britain's third route graded 9a after *Big Bang* in 1996 and *Mutation* in 1998.

 The route then saw little interest and it wasn't until a decade later that it finally saw a repeat ascent. That repeat was by an extremely talented, 17 year old, Czech climber Adam Ondra. Adam repeated the route in just one day. He also made a one day, second ascent of Kilnesy's other 9a, North Star[^1].

 The route saw sporadic attempts by Ben Moon but the third ascent was taken by German climber Alex Megos. Alex did the route in 2 days, after the first day was cut short by freezing conditions.

 It wasn't until last year, 2021, more than 2 decades after the first ascent, that route finally got it's first repeat by a Brit. Will Bosi climbed the route in June 2021 in two days. And 17 year old Josh Ibbetson made the fifth ascent in August.


[^1]: *North Star* was first climbed by Steve McClure in 2008 and has had only one repeat. Will Bosi tried it in 2021 and pulled off what is thought to be a crucial hold.
