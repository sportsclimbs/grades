So I wanted to try out some graph software because a web site focused on numbers probably needs graphs. I found some data from a board in the background of a Lattice video that I thought was interesting based on the results of a dead hang test.

So this test involves a one arm hang on a 20mm edge for 5 seconds. If you can hold yourself for 5 seconds you would get 100 because that's 100% of your body weight. Top climbers can add weight and so 110 means body weight plus 10%.

Possibly not the best use of a graph but at least I got the software working. More graphs coming soon hopefully.
