2021 has the best year by far for hard sport climbing in the UK. 

By tracking the number of ascents per year of hard sport routes (8c+ and above) 2021 has seen more than double that of any other year.

2020 held the previous record with total of 10 ascents of 8c+ and above in total. 2016 came a close second with 9 and 2011 with 8. 2021 has seen a total of 21 ascents[^1] highlighting the obvious rise in standards of UK climbers.

Additionally 2021 saw 3 new routes in this grade range, something that has possibly never been done before. In 1995 3 routes of 8c+ were climbed but one of these, *Total Eclipse*, has been disputed.

## 8c+ and above in 2021

Here is a list of the year's hardest ascents in chronological order.

1. *Rainshadow* 12th ascent by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña
2. New direct finish to *Make it Funky*, *Persian Dawn* (8c+) by Buster Martin
3. A new 8c+ route at Kilnsey, *Preposterous Tales* by Alex Barrows
4. The second ascent of *Batshadow* (9a/+) at Malham by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña
5. The second ascent of *The Wild West* (8c+) at Raven Tor by Will Bosi
6. The fourth ascent (first British repeat) of *Northern Lights* (9a) at Kilnsey by Will Bosi.
7. The twelfth ascent of *Progress* (8c+) by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña. He suggests a downgrade after using new kneebar beta.
8. The thirteenth ascent of *Progress* by (8c+) Josh Ibbetson.
9. The fourteenth ascent of *Progress* (8c+) by Ted Kingsnorth.
10. The fifteenth ascent of *Progress* (8c+) by Pete Dawson.
11. The fifth ascent of *Northern Lights* (9a) by Josh Ibbetson.
12. The third ascent of *Batshadow* (9a/+) by Josh Ibbetson.
13. The eleventh ascent of *Evolution* (8c+) by Ethan Walker.
14. The fourth ascent of *Batman* (9a/+) by Toby Roberts.
15. The eleventh ascent of *Hubble* (9a?) by Toby Roberts.
16. The second ascent of *Mutation* (9a+) by Will Bosi.
17. The twelfth ascent of *Evolution* (8c+) by Toby Roberts.
18. The second ascent of *Persian Dawan* (8c+) by Pete Dawson
19. First ascent of *Brandenburg Gate* (9a+) by Will Bosi.
20. The third ascent of *Persian Dawn* (8c+) by Will Bosi.
21. Third ascent of *Stevolution* (9a) by Toby Roberts.
22. Fourth ascent of *Hooligan* (8c or 8c+) by Will Bosi with a suggested upgrade to 8c+. [^4]




Aside from these ascents there were a number of impressive attempts on routes. Britain's only 9b, *Rainman* at Malham saw competition for the coveted second ascent. Josh Ibbetson, Eder Lomba Lopez and Toby Roberts have all now redpointed the two lines that make up *Rainman*. That is *Rainshadow* and *Batman*.

Over at Kilnsey Steve McClure's *Northern Lights* (9a) saw some strong attempts by Ben Moon, Ryan Pasquill and  Eder Lomba Lopez, all having redpointed to high on the route.



## Sketchy grades

In June Eder repeated *Progress* at Kilnsey finding two new kneebar rests on this power-endurance route. He thinks this makes a substantial difference to the difficulty saying it is now comparable in difficulty to *True North*, the 8c some 10m to the R of *Progress*. The route saw three subsequent ascents by Josh Ibbetson, Ted Kingsnorth, and Pete Dawson. Josh and Ted both used kneebars with kneepads. Ted Kingsnorth felt for him the route was still worth 8c+ though:

> Important to mention I used a kneebar recently found by @ederlomba at the 6th bolt which allows a shake in each arm which defo helps but it’s not amazing, not hands off for me at least! Plus you need to climb the meat of the hard climbing to get there. I still think the route holds its grade despite this.

This view was also shared by Josh Ibbetson who thought *Progress* to be a grade harder than *True North*. Neither Josh nor Ted used Eder's 5th bolt knee bar by the 'eyes'. Ted said "it is very specialised using two legs, one braced behind the other and we were unable to get anything out of it". So it sounds unlikely that this kneebar will ever become standard practice on the route.

In the Peak District Will Bosi made the fourth ascent of the short and bouldery *Hooligan*. The is graded 8c though Will thought it worth 8c+:

> Hooligan felt at least as hard as Persian Dawn and took a couple sessions to send so 8c+ I thought seems more fair.

Will has just about more experience than anyone on  Raven Tor's hardest routes and is in a good place to judge having climbed most of them in the previous year. It's also worth mentioning that up until recently *Hubble* was the benchmark for 8c+. If a route wasn't as hard as *Hubble* it would have been given 8c. Now that *Hubble* is widely regarded as 9a it makes sense that some of the previous 8c's are actually harder.
