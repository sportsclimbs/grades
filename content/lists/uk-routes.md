This lists all routes of 8c+ and above. Such a list is inevitably somewhat subjective. Not included here are extended boulder problems or hybrid boulder routes.



Steve McClure has been the dominent force in UK sport climbing for over 2 decades and despite impressive recent activity by the younger generation he has still done more hard ascents[^1a] than anyone else. What is perhaps surprising is that he hasn't done more though. Of the 33 routes listed below he has climbed less than half having ticked 14. Steve's focus has been the Peak District and Yorkshire and misses out on routes further from home: Wales, Scotland and Devon. 

The runners up place is held by Will Bosi who has rapidly closed the gap up with 13 ascents [^1], an astonishing 5 of which were climbed in 2021. He is followed by Pete Dawson who has climbed 8 routes with his second ascent of *Persian Dawn* in late 2021, placing him ahead Pete Robins who has climbed 6 routes of 8c+.

The hardest crags are Malham Cove and Raven Tor, each with 8 and 10 routes[^2] listed. Malham has *Rainman* the country's only 9b. Raven Tor now has two 9a+'s, *Mutation* and *Brandenburg Gate*.

The best year for hard ascents was [2021](/articles/2021/) by a long margin. Other good years were [2020](/articles/hardest-of-2020/) with 10 ascents in total, 2016 with 9 and 2011 with 8.

There are several questions around the difficulty of *Kaabah*[^3], *Progress*[^4], *Total Eclipse*[^5] and *Sea of Tranquillity*[^6]. See the [Notes](#notes) section below. 

{{< data/uk-routes >}}



[^1a]: Defined here as routes of 8c+ or harder.

[^1]: Bosi's tally is based upon his upgrade for **Hooligan** to 8c+.

[^2]: Raven Tor has 9 routes if **Hooligan** is counted as 8c+.


[^3]: **Kaabah** has only the first ascent listed because that was the only known ascent that did the crux of the original line. Subsequent ascents use a minor variation reducing the difficulty.

[^4]: **Progress** at Kilnsey was originally an 8c route but became harder after the loss of holds in 1997. Steve McClure made the first ascent in it's current 8c+ incarnation in 2006. In 2021 Eder Lomba Lopez de IpinÌƒa used kneepads on the route and felt it made a significant difference to the difficulty of the route. Several ascents followed in quick succession.

[^5]: John Dunne's ascent of **Total Eclipse** has been disputed. There is conflicting evidence regarding this route.

[^6]: There is a variation on **Sea of Tranquillity** that bypasses the font 8A crux sequence and makes the route 'only' 8c (the grade it was originally given).
