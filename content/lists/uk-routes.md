summary: List of UK routes and all ascents of 8c+ and above.
---

This hopefully lists all routes of 8c+ and above. Such a list is inevitably somewhat subjective. Not included here are extended boulder problems or hybrid boulder routes.

Steve McClure has been the dominent force in UK sport climbing for over 2 decades and it's no surprise he has done the most routes here. What is perhaps surprising is that he hasn't done more though. Of the 31 routes he has less than half having ticked 14. Steve's focus has been the Peak District and Yorkshire and misses out on routes further from home: Wales, Scotland and Devon. 

The runners up place is currently taken by Pete Robbins with 6 routes of 8c+ narrowly beating 3 climbers with 5 routes: Ben Moon, Malcolm Smith and Pete Dawson. These 3 however have all done 2 9a's.

The hardest crag, by a signifcant margin is Malham Cove, not just by number (8 routes listed) but also the hardest with the only 9b and two 9a+'s. In second place comes Raven Tor with 5 routes.

The best years have been 2020 with 11 ascents in total, 2016 with 10 and 2011 with 9.

## Notes

1. **Kaabah** has only the first ascent listed because that was the only known ascent that did the crux of the original line. Subsequent ascents use a minor variation reducing the difficulty.
2. **Progress** at Kilnsey was originally an 8c route but became harder after the loss of holds in 1997. Steve McClure made the first ascent in it's current 8c+ incarnation in 2006.
4. **Mutation** has seen serious attempts by very strong climbers and is widely rumoured to be 9a+. 
5. John Dunne's ascent of **Total Eclipse** has been disputed. There is conflicting evidence regarding this route.
