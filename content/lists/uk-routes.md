## 2021 is the best year for hard* ascents in the UK.

This hopefully lists all routes of 8c+ and above. Such a list is inevitably somewhat subjective. Not included here are extended boulder problems or hybrid boulder routes.

Steve McClure has been the dominent force in UK sport climbing for over 2 decades and it's no surprise he has done the most routes here. What is perhaps surprising is that he hasn't done more though. Of the 33 routes he has less than half having ticked 14. Steve's focus has been the Peak District and Yorkshire and misses out on routes further from home: Wales, Scotland and Devon. 

The runners up place is currently shared by Pete Robbins and Will Bosi with 6 routes each though Bosi's routes are harder and include 4 9a's. After this there are 3 climbers with 5 routes each: Ben Moon, Malcolm Smith and Pete Dawson. Young Josh Ibbetson's efforts cannot be left out either. He's done 4 routes in this list but 3 of those have been 9a's.

The hardest crag, by a signifcant margin is Malham Cove, not just by number (8 routes listed) but also the hardest with the country's only 9b and two 9a+'s. In second place comes Raven Tor with 5 routes.

The best years previously were 2020 with 11 ascents in total, 2016 with 10 and 2011 with 9.

But 2021 is now up to 12 ascents with a few months left and some almost completed projects by several climbers.

The so far:

1. *Rainshadow* 12th ascent by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña
2. New direct finish to *Make it Funky*, *Persian Dawn* (8c+) by Buster Martin
3. A new 8c+ route at Kilnsey, *Preposterous Tales* by Alex Barrows
4. The second ascent of *Batshadow* (9a/+) at Malham by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña
5. The second ascent of *The Wild West* (8c+) at Raven Tor by Will Bosi
6. The fourth ascent (first British repeat) of *Northern Lights* (9a) at Kilnsey by Will Bosi.
7. The eleventh ascent of *Progress* (8c+) by Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña. He suggests a downgrade after using new kneebar beta.
8. The twelth ascent of *Progress* by Josh Ibbetson
9. The thirteenth ascent of *Progress* by Ted Kingsnorth.
10. The fourteenth ascent of *Progress* by Pete Dawson.
11. The fifth ascent of *Northern Lights* by Josh Ibbetson.
12. The third ascent of *Batshadow* by Josh Ibbetson.

Additionally both Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña and Josh Ibbetson were getting close to the first repeat of Steve McClure's *Rainman* (9b) and Will Bosi has got very close to making the second ascent of Steve McClure's *Mutation* (9a/+) at Raven Tor.

In June Eder repeated *Progress* at Kilnsey finding two new kneebar rests on this power-endurance route. He thinks this makes a substantial difference to the difficulty saying it is now comparable in difficulty to *True North*, the 8c some 10m to the R of *Progress*. The route saw three subsequent ascents by Josh Ibbetson, Ted Kingsnorth, and Pete Dawson. Josh and Ted both used kneebars with kneepads. Ted Kingsnorth felt for him the route was still worth 8c+ though:

> Important to mention I used a kneebar recently found by @ederlomba at the 6th bolt which allows a shake in each arm which defo helps but it’s not amazing, not hands off for me at least! Plus you need to climb the meat of the hard climbing to get there. I still think the route holds its grade despite this.

This view was also shared by Josh Ibbetson who thought *Progress* to be a grade harder than *True North*. Neither Josh nor Ted used Eder's 5th bolt knee bar by the 'eyes'. Ted said "it is very specialised using two legs, one braced behind the other and we were unable to get anything out of it". So it sounds unlikely that this kneebar will ever become standard practice on the route.

*Northern Lights* is has also seen serious attempts by Ryan Pasquill, Ben Moon, Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña. All have made strong redpoint goes with Ryan and Ben falling above the last bolt.

## Notes

1. **Kaabah** has only the first ascent listed because that was the only known ascent that did the crux of the original line. Subsequent ascents use a minor variation reducing the difficulty.
2. **Progress** at Kilnsey was originally an 8c route but became harder after the loss of holds in 1997. Steve McClure made the first ascent in it's current 8c+ incarnation in 2006. In 2021 Eder Lomba Lopez de Ipiña used kneepads on the route and felt it made a significant difference to the difficulty of the route. Several ascents followed in quick succession.
4. **Mutation** has seen serious attempts by very strong climbers and is widely rumoured to be 9a+. 
5. John Dunne's ascent of **Total Eclipse** has been disputed. There is conflicting evidence regarding this route.
