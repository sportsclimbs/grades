summary: A list of grade 9 routes done in the 1990s and thoughts on what was the first 9a+.
---

The 1990s saw the first 9a, though which route was it still up for debate. Ben Moon's *Hubble* is the earliest contender. Climbed in 1991 Moon graded it 8c+ because it was harder than anything else he had done. Today it is widely considered 9a.

The next condender, and widely recognized by many as the first, is Wolfgang Gullich's *Action Directe* in the German Frankenjura. Gullich never gave his route a french grade he gave it a German grade of XI. Converting into french grades gave it 8c+/9a.

If *Hubble* and *Action Directe* were still contentious then Alex Huber's *Om* at Endstal in Germany is less so. First climbed in 1992 it wasn't until 17 years later that it was repeated by Adam Ondra. Adam repeated the route in 2 days and confirmed the 9a grade.

## First 9a+ ?

The 9a+ is widely believed to be Chris Sharma's ascent of *Biography* in 2001. But as this list shows there are 4 contenders for that grade in the decade before. Stefan FÃ¼rst's ascent of *Qui* in 1996 took around 60 days of effort and was unrepeated for 23 years. The route was graded 8c+, compared to the 8c+/9a of *Action Directe*. It [finally sucumbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90TzucYwW0M) to efforts by Adam Ondra in 2019 following around 12 days of attempts spread over 11 years. After a foothold broke in 2012 he said "the route will surely not be less than hard 9a+" but also felt the foothold would be insignificant to the overall difficulties.

The same year (1996) Alex Huber climbed *Open Air*, another 9a at Schleierwasserfall in Austria. Ondra did the second ascent of this route in 2008 and thought it to be 9a+. According to [Escalade 9](http://escalade9.wifeo.com/open-air.php):

> If this rating of 9a+ was confirmed, it would make "Open Air" the first 9a + in the world.

In 1998 Steve McClure added *Mutation* to the UK's infamous Raven Tor. This is another route that has not seen a repeat for more than 2 decades despite attempts by some the world's strongest climbers. This is widely rumoured to be 9a+.

Finally there is *Orujo* a Spanish cave route climbed in 1998 by Bernabe Fernandez. This route is still unrepeated and the first ascenionist is something of an unknown quantity. This was Spain's first route to be given a ninth grade and was the first in the world to be given 9a+. 

So any of these *could* be 9a+ or possibly none of them are. Only time will tell. Meanwhile Sharma's 2001 *Biography* which has been averaging about 1 ascent per year is well established as pretty much the definition of 9a+.
