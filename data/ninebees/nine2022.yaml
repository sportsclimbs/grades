  summary: 
  notes: 'Adam said, \"Unfortunately, I cannot give it 9b+ as it only took me 5 days of cleaning and trying (plus a few days in the neighbouring variation), but I think it is definitely on the upper end of the grading scale. It is very much my style - tricky kneebars to rest and very reach moves on tiny holds. I think it is probably 8b+ with some kneebars (that allows you to be pretty fresh), up to a very specific section of 10 moves, which could be an 8C boulder on its own ðŸ’ª Huge move off a bad kneebar using a tiny, slopy knob, then big cross-over move into 7mm crimp, and heartbreaking last hard move into horizontal three-finger slot.\"'
