## Focus

In the fast track world of the internet and social media climbing stories are spewed out with sensational regularity. The downside of this approach is that the really significant achievements tend to get pushed down media feeds too quickly and their sense of place in history can be vague. So the focus of this site is to redress that by focusing on the historical perspective on the biggest achievements in climbing.
