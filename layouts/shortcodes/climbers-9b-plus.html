        <p>Climbed the world&rsquo;s first 9b+ almost a decade ago, <em>Change</em>, which has only seen one repeat so far, by Stefano Ghisolfi who climbed it in 2020.<br>
            The following year he climbed two more first ascents with <em>La Dura Dura</em> and the short <em>Vasil Vasil</em> near his home in Czech Republic.<br>
            In 2017 he climbed the first 9c in the world <em>Silence</em> at the Flatanger cave in Norway, making him the only climber to have climbed this grade.</p>

        <p>Was the fourth person in the world to climb the 9b+ grade and make the first repeat <em>Perfecto Mundo</em> just 2 months after the first ascent. He has since climbed 2 more and additionally made the first ascent of Erebor. This is Italy&rsquo;s hardest route, and used a slash grade of 9b/+ meaning he is unsure of the grade. As well as climbing extremely hard rock routes Stefano also managed to win the overall title for the lead World cup in 2021 too.</p>

        <p>The strong Scottish climber made the first ascent this old unclimbed project in Siurana over 10 days. Given that he climbed Ondra&rsquo;s 9b La Capella in the same sector in only 3 days the previous year he reasoned this had to be a grade harder.</p>

        <p>French climber Seb Bouin made a quick second ascent of Adam Ondra&rsquo;s <em>Mamichula</em> link up in 2019, considered a hard 9b by Ondra. Since then he has climbed 4 more, 3 of which get the 9b/+ grade. Two of these were his own routes, still awaiting repeats, but as he&rsquo;s conscientous with his grades and at least one of these may end up being viewed as full 9b+ at some point.</p>

    <div class="notes">
        <p>After climbing many hard routes in the 9&rsquo;s Italian climber Laura Rogora made the second ascent of Stefano Ghisolfi&rsquo;s Erebor, Italy&rsquo;s hardest route. This is probably the hardest ascent by a woman. It took her 6 days to complete, managing all the moves on her first day. Ghisolfi has suggested she try <em>Bibliography</em> because it&rsquo;s not that much harder.</p>
